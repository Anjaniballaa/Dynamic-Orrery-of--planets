# NASA Orrery Model of Planets

An interactive, real-time orrery that visually simulates planetary motions and orbits with accurate positions and speeds. This project was contributed to NASA as part of an initiative to create an engaging and educational planetary model.

## 🚀 Features
- Realistic planetary movements and orbital paths.
- Enhanced animation performance with optimized rendering efficiency.
- Fully responsive design for seamless viewing on all devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** (for 3D visualization)

## 📌 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the interactive orrery model on your local machine:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-orrery.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd dynamic-orrery

# Open the main HTML file in your browser
# Locate `home.html` in the project directory.
# Open it in any modern web browser to start the simulation.
```

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Adding more planets and moons to expand the solar system model.
- Introducing adjustable time scales for faster or slower orbital views.
- Implementing additional celestial phenomena like asteroids and comets.
